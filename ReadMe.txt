Hello! This project was done in Colab Notebook by Google. I have all the information needed to understand what is happening there, you really don't even need to know how to code to use it!

For some reason, Github will not always load the notebook. To fix this, you can select the project .ipynb URL, which is as follows: https://github.com/Rdevrie2/Random-Forest-Example/blob/main/DMAP_SP21_Final_Project.ipynb

Then open up Google Colab, in the menu at the top select 'File', and then 'Open Notebook'. After this select the 'GitHub' tab and post in the URL I have shown above, that should allow the notebook to open and run!
